# Asset Tracker

This project was created with the purpose of adding knowledge to their contributors. We look forward to tear down some of the most complicated topics of the technologies we handle and share easily throughout the code with comments.

## Start project locally

```sh
# Inside backend folder run the following commands
npm install

# run this command only if this is the first time in the repo
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# export PORT=3000 has the same effect. And then yarn run... 
PORT=3000 yarn run app:dev:start
```

- By now, you are good to go and test the endpoints;
